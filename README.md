The C256 Tracker is a music sequencing application written for the C256 Foenix retro computer.

Language is Assembly.
You will need the tass-64 assembler to compile this code.
Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/tass64/ to get it.

I'm currently using version *64tass Turbo Assembler Macro V1.54.1900*

The model I'm using is RAD Tracker https://www.3eality.com/productions/reality-adlib-tracker.
The C256 Tracker is only able to play version 1.1 RAD files. Implementation of RAD version 2.0 is left for later.

You will need the C256 Foenix IDE to code and debug: https://github.com/Trinity-11/FoenixIDE.

Finally, this code was updated for Rev C4 of the C256 Foenix board.

Cheers!
